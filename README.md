# FeaturePilot

FeaturePilot is an open-source feature flag and progressive delivery platform built for modern applications. It enables teams to safely release features, perform percentage-based rollouts, manage environments, track feature evaluations, and monitor release health through analytics and audit trails.

## Overview

FeaturePilot provides:

- Feature flag management
- Progressive rollouts
- Environment isolation
- Release management
- Evaluation event tracking
- Audit logging
- Analytics dashboard
- Redis-backed evaluation caching
- PostgreSQL persistence
- Docker-based deployment

## Core Features

### Feature Flags

Create and manage feature flags across multiple environments.

* Enable or disable features instantly
* Environment-specific configuration
* Unique feature keys per environment

### Progressive Rollouts

Gradually expose features to users using deterministic rollout percentages.

```text
Rollout Percentage: 25%

Users:
✓ User A
✓ User B
✗ User C
✗ User D
```

FeaturePilot uses deterministic user bucketing to ensure rollout consistency.

### Environment Management

Support for multiple deployment environments:

* Development
* Staging
* Production
* Custom environments

### Release Management

Track releases and deployment status.

Supported release states:

* Active
* Failed
* Rolled Back

### Audit Logging

Every critical action can be tracked:

* Feature creation
* Feature enablement
* Feature disablement
* Release operations

### Evaluation Tracking

Every feature evaluation can be stored for analytics purposes.

Captured data:

* Environment
* Feature key
* User ID
* Evaluation result
* Timestamp

### Analytics Dashboard

Monitor:

* Total feature evaluations
* Feature adoption
* Traffic distribution
* Release health
* Risk indicators

* Go
* Gin
* PostgreSQL
* Redis
* Prometheus

## Services

| Service          | URL                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dashboard        | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)           |
| Analytics API    | [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) |

## API Example

### Create Feature

```http
POST /features
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "environment_id": "env-id",
  "key": "new_checkout",
  "name": "New Checkout",
  "description": "Next generation checkout flow",
  "rollout_percentage": 20
}
```

### Evaluate Feature

```http
POST /evaluate
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "environment": "production",
  "feature_key": "new_checkout",
  "user_id": "user-123"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "enabled": true
}
```

## Caching Strategy

Evaluation results are cached in Redis.

Cache key format:

```text
feature:<environment>:<feature_key>:<user_id>
```

Benefits:

* Lower database load
* Faster evaluations
* Consistent rollout decisions

## Monitoring

Prometheus metrics are exposed for:

* Total evaluations
* Cache hits
* Cache misses
* Evaluation errors
* Evaluation latency
